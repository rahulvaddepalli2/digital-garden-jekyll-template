title: Self-Mastery
---
We all seek a world of peace. If only, we realized that it is possible. 
If we first sought to seek peace within.

- Your entire external world changes once you change your internal world.
- If we are to reach our potentials in search of mastery, we must first master ourselves. In mastering ourselves, we are able to devote ourselves to our craft.
- You can achieve mastery in pursuit of external rewards (women, money, status, etc). If this describes you, let me offer you a statement, that you'll likely overlook. You will not be fulfilled. The world constantly tells us this, yet we march on ahead, only to learn from direct experience.
