Concepts:
- The voice is an instrument
	- We each have our own unique synth: our voice.


- The muse
	- Is usually depicted as a woman, residing within our inner world(s).
	- acts as a source of inspiration
	- relates to the anima (in my mind)

- Immerse yourself
	- An immersion, a losing yourself within the art, within life, really... is key.

- The flavor of your ingredient
	- When you play a note, the way you play (soft, forceful, fast, slow) it brings a different flavor. 
  	  It's almost like one key actually contains hundreds of keys. 
  	  Play with that.
	  
- Lens
	- If you want to be great, find the magicians. The lens through which they see things are valuable.
		- Lens to ask yourself:
			- What would it be to only make a beat with a single element, like your voice?
			- What would it be like to create ideas with only your voice?
	  
- Breaking down the great(s):
	- Jon Bellion
		- Is meticulous about the pockets that his drums are hitting.
		- Frequently incorporates his voice into the beat.
		- Wants his songs to represent pixar
			- Pixar is simplicity & vibrance and color, something kids & adults can enjoy
			- Pixar movies are great, partly due to the fact that the original draft is re-made, resulting in a better final draft.
	- Kanye West
		- Is his own biggest fan
	- J Cole
		- I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style. I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now.
		- Cole used to start with melody, but learned quickly, as most do, that hip hop production is heavily centered around drums and finding swing in your drum programming. 
	
- The greats seem to envision the track, and look to capture an emotion.
	  
The craft:
- Ad libs as ear candy
- Creation vs judgment mode
- The greatest artists have this childlike nature
- An interesting angle is to look at the bridge of the song as a reward for listener for getting there.
- Good artists copy, great artists steal.
	  
- Definition(s):
	- Swing
		- Overall feel or groove of the rhythm
	
	- What is the downbeat?
		- In a standard 4/4, each count is the downbeat: 1, 2, 3, 4
