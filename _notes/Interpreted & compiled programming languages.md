- Both compilers & interpreters are translators. They take human-readable code & convert it into computer-readable machine code.

- Interpreted:

		- LIMITATION(s):
		- EXAMPLE(s): Javascript, Ruby, Python, etc.

- Compiled
	- Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code
		- LIMITATION(s):
		- EXAMPLE(s): C, C++, etc.
