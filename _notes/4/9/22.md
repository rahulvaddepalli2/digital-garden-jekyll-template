I've been watching travel videos about other tribes, it's interesting to think about what are the common threads of my modern life to their lives.
- They love to sing & dance, they are always in each other's faces.
- Humans have always entertained each other. Especially when there is no TV.

A good question to ask myself is, what would I do if I just went to meditate after a work session, with the lens of understanding myself... what would I lean towards?

It may be an inner journey I seek. 

What is the mechanism of Devotion?
- Like we can experience bliss constantly.
