I've found myself re-engaged with Josh Waitzkin. Particularity the talk with Tim Ferris titled "how to cram 2 months of learning into a week".
- So, taking inspiration from that, I'd like to re-ask myself:
	- Who are you as a learner?
		- I enjoy activites that I'm able to get lost in (ie, basketball, music)
		-
		
It's interesting that I've taken notes on many "valuable talks", but the true key is the active use of those nuggets of wisdom.
