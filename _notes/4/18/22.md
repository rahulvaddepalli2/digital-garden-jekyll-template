I've been curious about nature & how untainted a child's mind is. How a child acts according to his nature, because he hasn't been conditioned otherwise. A child is sponatanous & acts instinctively. A child lives moment-to-moment. 
- How can you incorporate this into your art?
	- Trust yourself. Do things for their own sake. 

I've been reading Kapil Gupta, here and there. His words are of great interest to me. The truths he shares cause the mind to revolt. I enjoy reading the words of those who display authenticity & are seemingly deliberate in their mimesis. 

I've also been captured by the idea of intuition. I'm reminded of a trip I had. The perspective I had was eye-opening. I was able to feel (in a way I'd never felt before) the forces that bind us all. The tension we feel as a part of interaction. I felt in a way that seemed different (the level of empathy & intuition was different). Perhaps the two hemispheres of my brain were able to better connect in that state. 

True change comes from inwards. It comes from a transformation. 

In addition to Kapil Gupta, I've also been skimming "the power of now". It mentions many similar concepts such as surrender. I'm touched by their words & have been doing some inner work. I'm starting to understand how asleep I've been. I'm curious what manifests when I stop all addictions. 

What behaviors will I gravitate towards? What path will I follow?
