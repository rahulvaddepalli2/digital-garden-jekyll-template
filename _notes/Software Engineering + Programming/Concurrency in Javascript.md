How is concurrency enabled in Javascript?
- JavaScript has a concurrency model based on an [[event loop]], which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.

- The default for concurrency in JavaScript is an asynchronous programming model using callbacks, Promise or async/await.
