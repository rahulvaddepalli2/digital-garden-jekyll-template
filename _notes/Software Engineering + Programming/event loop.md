title: event loop
---
The event loop is a constantly running loop that processes tasks, rendering, and microtasks. These events get placed within the event queue (to-do list) & the event loop constantly checks this "to-do list" to execute events.
1. Task Queues
2. The render steps (what the browser uses to update what's on the screen)
3. Microtasks (Speaker strongly associates microtasks with Promises)
