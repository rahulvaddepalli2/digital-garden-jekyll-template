As software engineers, our goal is not just to solve problems. 
Rather, our goal is to solve problems efficiently and elegantly. 
Not all solutions are made equal!

We analyze the efficiency of algorithms in terms of their:
- Time Complexity (Speed)
- Space Complexity (Memory Consumption)


We should focus on how the performance of our algorithm is effected by increasing the size of the input. In other words, how does our performance scale?

In Computer Science, we use [[Big-O notation]] as a tool for describing the efficiency of algorithms with respect to the size of the input argument.
