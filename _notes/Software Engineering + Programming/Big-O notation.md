title: Big-O Notation
---

Big Picture Ideas of Big-O Notation:
1.  The function should be defined in terms of the size of the input(s).
2.  A _smaller_ Big-O function is more desirable than a larger one. Intuitively, we want our algorithms to use the _minimal_ amount of time and memory possible.
3.  Big-O describes the worst case scenario, also known as the upper-bound. We prepare our algorithm for the worst-case, because the best-case is a luxury we can't guarantee.
4.  A Big-O function should be simplified to show only it's most dominant mathematical term.
