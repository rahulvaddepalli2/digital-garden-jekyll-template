			“I suppose I would say that “work” is perhaps best spent getting in touch with your instinct. To crawl inside of it. To become intimate with it. So that it may serve you as it has served me.” — A Master's Secret Whispers: Kapil Gupta

				My interpretation: 
				Instinct, which comes from nature. 
				Most time in “work” should be spent intimately with instinct.
