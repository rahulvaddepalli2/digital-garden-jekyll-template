"The unserious human craves prescriptions 
For they validate and perpetuate his unseriousness. 
The serious human flees from prescriptions 
For they stand in the way of his Arrival."
â€” Kapil Gupta

David Perell says, prescriptions offer a map of the territory, which you can then learn to navigate on your own through your experience. It's important to remember that a map is never substitutable for experience navigating that territory.
