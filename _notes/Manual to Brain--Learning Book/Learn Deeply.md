title: Learn Deeply
---
Process the information you’re learning deeply. 

You can do this by trying to explain it to a peer or writing about it (Ie, what I’m doing with this book). By processing information deeply, it becomes a part of you rather than information that is easily forgotten. 

The greatest thinkers are practitioners of deep thinking, and thus discoveries are revealed to them through their techniques of practice. If you establish in yourself the style of doing great things, then when opportunity comes you almost automatically respond with greatness in your actions. You have trained to think and act in the proper ways.

Hence the saying, _“Luck favors the prepared mind”._

Deep understanding requires (and is a result of) intense personal connection. Learning matters insofar as it influences our future thoughts and actions. In fact, because [[Understanding requires effortful engagement]], learning is only a _consequence_ of a rich tapestry of thoughts and actions woven with those concepts.

When an activity’s real purpose is something intrinsically meaningful to the participant, their earnest intellectual participation will naturally produce effortful engagement with the ideas involved.**
