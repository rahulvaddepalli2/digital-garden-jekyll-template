title: Spaced Repetition

The science has proven that spacing out repetitions of your learning (i.e., through flashcards, answering questions, etc) is most effective for long-term memory.

Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice, but there is another problem. Retention is not valuable for its own sake. If you memorized the Spanish language, but never spoke it, what use is it? 

Memory is valuable insofar as it helps people do whatever gives their lives meaning: [[Tools for thought should be evaluated in the context of intrinsically meaningful purposes]]
