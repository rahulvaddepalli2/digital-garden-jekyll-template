title: The magic ability of our brains
---
Our brains have this amazing capacity to change over the course of our lives. 
In neuroscience, this concept has a name—neuroplasticity.

neuro = brain
plasticity = ability to change

During our adolescent years, we are learning machines, as we figure out how to survive & adapt to our environments. In fact our brains continue to have plasticity occur somewhat automatically until around the age of 25. After the age of 25, our brains still have the ability to change but it’s necessary to deliberately focus on learning & practice to access neuroplasticity.
