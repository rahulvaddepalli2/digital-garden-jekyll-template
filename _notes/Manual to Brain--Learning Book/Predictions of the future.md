“The only constant is _change_.”

Yuval Noah Harari, predicts that for the individual of the future, In order to keep up with the world of 2050, you will need not merely to invent new ideas and products – you **will above all need to reinvent yourself again and again**. For as the pace of change increases, not just the economy, but the very meaning of “being human” is likely to mutate.

Most important of all will be the ability to deal with change, to learn new things and to preserve your mental balance in unfamiliar situations.

If this is where our future is headed, then the ability to learn & change yourself is paramount, which is another reason I find compiling this information into one book is so valuable.
