title: Brain-States
---
During waking states, your brain is mainly managing 2 states:

1.  Passing things off to reflexive behavior
    -   Behavior that you don’t have to think about, it isn’t cognitively demanding
    
2.  Duration-Path-Outcome (non-reflexive behavior)
    -   Behavior that you do have to think about, that is cognitively demanding
        -   How long is something going to last? (Duration)
        -   What's the path to do it? (Path)
        -   How is it going to work out? (Outcome)

Another lens to approach brain-states is:
-   Focused
-   Diffused

When learning, there are times in which you are focused and times in which you allow your mind to wander. This unfocused, or diffused, mode is just as valuable as the focused mode in allowing your brain to LEARN something. 

So — take breaks, meditate, think about other things, and give yourself plenty of time in both modes.
