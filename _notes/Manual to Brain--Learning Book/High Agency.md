When you are told that something is impossible, that you're too "old", don't have the experience, is that the end of the conversation? Or does it spark a second thought in your mind of how can I get around this roadblock?
- I'm poor. Even so, how am I going to become wealthy?
- I can't find a partner. Even so, how can I meet someone?

This is high agency. 
It's about finding a way regardless of circumstances.

Can you guess, which person (A or B) is high agency?

High Agency is an important component of becoming a master learner. A learning journey is deeply personal, meaning you're often alone in your pursuit, especially when starting. There's not much hand-holding going on, and when you venture out into the land of mastery, your journey will be guided by your instincts. You'll be required to self-reflect, face unique problems, & no one else can do the work for you.

- Other notes:
	- Jeff Bezo's framework for identifying high-agency friends/romantic partners: 
		- "If you were stuck in a third world prison and had to call one person to try and bust you out of there. Who would you call?"

	- Peter Theil's question to bring out high agency thinking:
		- "How can you achieve your 10 year goal in 6 months?"

	- Also called "Orthaganol Thinking" by Naval
		- Ask questions to give you a completely different angle to frame the problem. If you think sideways, you can see ridiculous ideas that the crowd missed.
