title: Why Meta-Learning is important
---

Meta learning is a branch of metacognition with learning about one’s own learning and learning processes.

Meta-learning is originally described by Donald B. Maudsley (1979) as "the process by which learners become aware of and increasingly in control of habits of perception, inquiry, learning, and growth that they have internalized”.

Meta-learning (learning how to learn) is important because life _is_ learning. Your brain is a complex adaptation machine. As you go through life, you must adapt to the environments you live in. Your ability to learn & recognize patterns serves as the true ticket to equal opportunity. Knowing that with enough time, energy & focus, you can learn any new skill offers you a life of freedom. The problems you face, whether financial or career-related, can be solved and you can pursue the life you desire. It’s not going to be easy. But it’s going to be worth it.

If you’re going to be learning anyway.. why not make sure you know HOW to learn?

If our brains enabled us to become apex predators and rule the world, why not read the "manual" to your brain?
