title: Focus = Neuroplasticity
---
The strongest drive for adult neuroplasticity is focus.

-   If you want your brain to learn, how do you do it?
    -   By attacking 2 separate parts:
        1.  There has to be a high level of focus, urgency, and engagement (regardless of emotion/agitation).
        2.  States of deep sleep or states where you’re not doing D-P-O

The signal that generates plasticity is the making of errors.

-   Focus → Errors → Frustration → Plasticity

If you can leverage frustration toward drilling deeper into a problem, endeavor, etc. you set yourself up for a terrific set of plasticity mechanisms to engage.

Find the times in the day when you have the highest mental acuity (i.e., mornings , after rest). This is when you want to engage in these learning bouts.

Then get to the point where you are making errors & keep making errors for 7 - 30 minutes. Find pleasure in the frustration.

You've created the optimal neurochemical cocktail for learning that thing & for learning things afterward. At least for an hour or so, you'll be in a state of heightened learning.

The neurobiological explanation for learning a skill is you want to perform as many repetitions as you can, especially when you're first starting to learn a skill. (More reps per unit time)

Post learning session: take 5-10 minutes to relax without any sensory input allows you to further embed the skill. Your brain actually replays the events in reverse.
