title: Why I Wrote This Book
---

Writing is thinking. Writing this book is my attempt to think _deeply_ about the idea of learning. This book will be a resource that’ll develop as I move through life. By taking all my knowledge on learning, the brain, mind, memory, human nature and more, I’m developing a manual to our brains. Some cheat codes, if you will. A resource that will help me (and hopefully you, the _reader_) in the journey of life.

Never forget, life is learning.

While studying neuroscience at UC Davis, I began to understand the “magic” of our brains. The brain is the reason we can plan for the future, problem solve, learn, change our lives for the better and many more magical things.

Through my understanding, I started to realize that we _ALL_ have the ability to truly do anything. This sparked a desire to share my worldview, so our old narratives about not being able to grow, change, and learn won’t propagate. I want to share what I know, because being “unaware” of this information is unfortunate. Yet if you’re aware and still choose not to accept the truth of our capabilities, then I wish you well, but you’re not living to your fullest potential. And since I’ve only got one shot at this thing we call life, I’d like to live it to mine.

To those who take this knowledge & apply it to your lives—_the world is your oyster_.
