Mental clarity is the capacity to think clearly & is a result of proper nutrition (i.e., diet, sleep, fasting). If you've ever felt the difference between a full night's sleep & a good meal vs poor sleep & a 20 piece mcnuggets, then you'll know what I'm talking about. Your levels of energy are just different. 

When I say fasting, in part I mean, not eating (your level of focus becomes next-level). But also a fasting of the mind. This is why meditation is useful.
