- Creativity seems, among other things, to be "usefully" putting together things which were not perceived to be related before, and it may be the initial psychological distance between the things which counts the most.
- A long gestation period of intense thinking about the problem may result in a solution, or else the temporary abandonment of the problem. This temporary abandonment is a common feature of many great creative acts. The temporary dropping of the idea sometimes seems to be essential to let the [[subconscious]] find a new approach. Then comes the moment of [[insight]], creativity, or whatever you want to call itâ€”you see the solution. It often happens that you are wrong; a closer examination of the problem shows the solution is faulty, but might be saved by some subtle revision. But maybe the problem needs to be altered to fit the solution! This has happened! More usually it is back to the drawing board, as they say, more mulling things over.

My Thoughts:
- Creativity is inherent to humans. If we can think of the brain as a network of connections, then creative acts occur when your mind makes the proper connections, unvealing a sense-making insight.
