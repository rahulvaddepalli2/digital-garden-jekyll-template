- One type of presence of mind, is beginner's mind. The mind that knows nothing. The mind that is a true beginner.
- [[Beginner's mind]] is a step beyond mastery. You clear your mind of all you know, the moment you enter the battlefield. Otherwise, you carry thoughts into the battle based on the wrong Karma. You cannot know what forces are in play, until you are in the heat of battle.
	- Karma is the full set of circumstances the world presents to you that are beyond your control.
	- Dharma is your own set of thoughts and actions. These are within your control.
		- You must find a Dharma that fits your Karma.
		- You must 'go with the flow'.
