- I'm moving back to Plumas Lake, I'm currently writing this while in SD though. I've been making music almost daily. I'm about to start working at Inductive Automation, it should be an interesting journey. I'll be able to make money to invest in myself. 
- I am serious about turning on another gear in the coming months. I am blessed to enjoy absolutely delicious—and healthy !!—food, which makes my life easier. I'll have a better ability to focus on myself. My YouTube, music, and comedy.
- I am going to wake up early to work on my craft & make videos, because I have the most energy in the mornings.

What do you feel about your time in quarantine in SD?
